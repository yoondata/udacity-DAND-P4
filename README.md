# udacity-DAND-P4

This is the fourth project that I completed for the Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) at Udacity in APR-JUL 2016. Using R, I cleaned and analyzed the [College Scoreboard Data from the U.S. Department of Education](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). Specifically, I conducted an exploratory data analysis to identify institution-level indicators of postgraduate financial success in higher education.
