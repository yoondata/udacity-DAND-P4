# udacity-DAND-P4

This is the fourth project that I completed for the Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) at Udacity in APR-JUL 2016. Using R, I cleaned and analyzed the [College Scoreboard Data from the U.S. Department of Education](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). Specifically, I conducted an exploratory data analysis to identify institution-level indicators of postgraduate financial success in higher education. You can preview the result through this [link](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/yoondata/udacity-DAND-P2/blob/master/PARK_Sangyoon_Udacity_DAND_P4.html).
